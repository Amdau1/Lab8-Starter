The idea of Graceful Degradation is that you you start off giving the users the fanciest feature. This does not target all users as the features are fency and not everyone will be able to use it. But as time goes on you give less fencier feature and start to consider user of all types of abilities. Service workers is basically what lets us use our website offline. It also improves perfomance of our websites. If service workers is not supporteb by your browser you will not be able to use most of the feature on the website. However, you will be able to use the basic function of the website.
